Library:
Behaviors:
Holds list of all scriptures
UserChoice():void   Asks the user to choose what scripture they would like to memorize,
then creates instance of scripture class to store that scripture.
ClearConsole():void   Clears the console when scripture is ready to be displayed.

Attributes:
Parallel lists, _allReferences and _allScriptures, hold each reference and the 
corresponding passage. The reference and corresponding passage have the same index.



Scripture:
Behaviors:
Scripture(string, string):void   the constructor will break the verse string into a list 
of words to be stored in _listOfWords attribute, and save the other string in _reference.
The strings from lists in Library class will be passed in.
Display():void   will show the scripture for the user to read with each hidden word blanked out.
HideWords():void   calls the word class to decide whether a word is hidden or not, and 
return a list of words whether shown or blanked out.
HiddenCompletely():Boolean   simply checks to see if all words are hidden, if all 
are hidden the program ends.

Attributes:
This class stores the scripture reference as _reference, and a list of words in the 
passage as _listOfWords.



Word:
Behaviors:
IsHidden():boolean   returns to the scripture class whether a word is hidden or not.
ShowHide():void   decides randomly if the word will be hidden or shown.
Display():string   returns the value of the word, whether the word, or a string of underscores.
Word(string):   the constructor will get one word of the passage from scripture and set
the Boolean attribute _isHidden as NULL initially.

Attributes:
_isHidden:Boolean   stores whether this word is hidden or shown.
_text:string   stores one word of the scripture passage.



Constructors:
Library():void   Doesn't need to do much aside from clear memory so no random values get
in the way in the program.

Scripture(string, string):void   the constructor will break the verse string into a list 
of words to be stored in _listOfWords attribute, and save the other string in _reference.
The strings from lists in Library class will be passed in.

Word(string):   the constructor will get one word of the passage from scripture and set
the Boolean attribute _isHidden as NULL initially.



Interaction:
The Library will function as the library of scriptures and metaphorically we as the user 
will go to the library where we can see and choose from the available scriptures.
When the user chooses a scripture, an instance of scripture will be created that contains 
the reference and passage of the scripture. Inside the scripture class, the verse will be 
broken up into a list of words. Now an instance of the Word class will be created for each 
word. The word class will decide what to hide, and return respective values. It will also 
inform the scripture class of each word that is hidden. The scripture class will use this 
information to reconstruct the verse with removed words and display it to the user. 
Scripture will also keep track of when all words become hidden. Scripture will return a 
value of whether all words are hidden yet, so the Program knows when to end.
